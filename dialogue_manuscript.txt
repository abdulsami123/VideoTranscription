SPEAKER_00: So give me, just tell us about waiter. Tell us the story, tell us the background, and then I'll pick up on pieces and I'll kind of stick my finger in the wounds as you get there. Okay. Well
SPEAKER_01: I'll
SPEAKER_00: 
SPEAKER_01: start off by saying, you know, most
SPEAKER_01: companies when they get started, they get started with a plan or somebody's been working on an idea for a long time or, you know, and you decide,
SPEAKER_01: okay, now's the time, I'm just going to do this. Well waiter didn't
SPEAKER_01: start that way, it actually started by accident. I was going to attend
SPEAKER_01: a startup weekend, a building similar to this opened up
SPEAKER_01: in Lake Charles called the Seeds Center and I was in between things
SPEAKER_01: and was trying to figure out what I was going to do next. So I
SPEAKER_01: attended a startup weekend event in Gainesville, Florida to organize startup weekend at the Seeds Center in Lake Charles, a great way
SPEAKER_01: to get a startup ecosystem going and so on. And I happened to
SPEAKER_01: join a team that built waiter, a waiter prototype and
SPEAKER_01: we actually
SPEAKER_01: won the startup weekend competition. So
SPEAKER_01: on a Sunday night we were judges and
SPEAKER_00: winners.
SPEAKER_01: Now on Monday I decided, well, now what I do.
SPEAKER_01: I came here
SPEAKER_01: to learn about
SPEAKER_01: startup weekend, now
SPEAKER_01: I've got this startup, everybody thinks it's a great idea and it's a little bit of an
SPEAKER_01: offshoot from something I had done in the past. So do I go back to Louisiana and start this? And the first thought I had was I should stay in Florida because no one can start a successful startup in Louisiana. And that's the God's honest
SPEAKER_01: truth. I mean, I left Louisiana in 1991 to go work in technology. I moved to Dallas for a
SPEAKER_01: worth, then moved to Silicon Valley for a while and then moved to Europe for a while, all working in technology. Because
SPEAKER_01: in 1991 I was told if you want to work in technology you got to get out
SPEAKER_01: of Louisiana. So that was my first thought and then I decided, well, let me go see if
SPEAKER_01: I could do this
SPEAKER_00: in Louisiana and so I came back and started the company. So I know a little bit about the kind of the
SPEAKER_00: pre-weighter world. Can you tell us kind of even how the concept came to be
SPEAKER_01: 
SPEAKER_01: 
SPEAKER_00: 
SPEAKER_01: where the idea for this
SPEAKER_01: delivery model even came from? Yes. So like I said, I was living in Dallas for worth in the early 2000s, 2003
SPEAKER_01: to be exact. I got out of technology and got into the restaurant
SPEAKER_01: business because I
SPEAKER_01: thought, well, boiling goes are so popular in South Louisiana, maybe
SPEAKER_01: I could make that work up here in South Lake Texas. That's a suburb of the
SPEAKER_01: Dallas-Walt-Worth area. And so I opened a place with my uncle who's Acadia Crophish and Crowley called Crophish
SPEAKER_01: City. And for three years we sold Crophish, but what we found out real quickly is people didn't want to drive through. They wanted to come and sit down and
SPEAKER_01: eat, right?
SPEAKER_01: Correct. So that didn't really work out the way we had thought. And so I thought, well, I bet people
SPEAKER_01: would want food delivered to their home. And so I started
SPEAKER_01: a concept called Mose to Go. And it was order
SPEAKER_01: on the internet and we'll deliver it to your door. We'll
SPEAKER_01: cook it and deliver it
SPEAKER_01: to your door. And we did that. And I
SPEAKER_01: had a friend that was in the commercial kitchen business.
SPEAKER_01: And he had a demo kitchen with all
SPEAKER_01: decked out with the best equipment any restaurant
SPEAKER_01: tour it could hope for. So I asked him if I could lease it for three months just to test the concept. And I did and it was pretty successful. But rent was really high in that area. So I couldn't
SPEAKER_00: roll it out. So I put it on the back burner and then fast
SPEAKER_00: forward to start a weekend in 2013 and I figured all right, waiter, Mose to Go. That's really what I wanted to do except I don't have to cook the food this way. So I'll go ahead and do it that way. And it was a much better choice. That's actually why I love waiter too because
SPEAKER_00: I don't have to cook. I don't have to go get it. I technically don't have to clean anything.
SPEAKER_00: I literally just throw it all the way. I think I told Jude,
SPEAKER_00: where is he?
SPEAKER_00: I told Jude, he was wearing me out. I just want you to know that. You
SPEAKER_00: got a good soldier. He was
SPEAKER_00: wearing me out. They had been in the center for,
SPEAKER_00: y'all been in the center for, I don't know. What? A couple months? And he goes, man, why haven't you ordered anything? I was
SPEAKER_01: like,
SPEAKER_00: ah, you know, I don't know. I don't know. So finally, I was like, ah, I'm going to order. Kids you not. So if I ordered on Friday, I ordered again on Sunday. And Tuesday, then Wednesday at lunch, then Wednesday at night. And I came in and I went, damn it Jude. You ruined my life, man. And now my wife, the other night, she goes, hey, I'm going to be late at work. But don't worry, I
SPEAKER_01: just waited. I
SPEAKER_01: love it. It's a verb now,
SPEAKER_00: right?
SPEAKER_01: I waited. I waited dinner. And I went, ah, damn, I just did the same thing. I got one
SPEAKER_01: going to the hospital where she was. Got one coming to my house. I was like, you know, I would have, no, that's actually works out better. I should have done a good one. I'm glad you. That's what we should have done. Absolutely. So it was beautiful. It was beautiful. So tell me about the start-up weekend thing because I feel like there's probably a pain point in there somewhere. When
SPEAKER_00: 
SPEAKER_01: you won this thing, I'm assuming you won some money that went along with some fun seed money, some kind of prize,
SPEAKER_01: something like that, right? Yeah, that's what you would think. Start-up weekend is actually an event
SPEAKER_01: that's sponsored by Google. And it's put on all over the
SPEAKER_01: world. But you don't win money. It's not a, it's a start-up competition for you win legal services, accounting services, time in
