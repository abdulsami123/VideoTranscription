 So give me, just tell us about waiter. Tell us the story, tell us the background, and then I'll pick up on pieces and I'll kind of stick my finger in the wounds as you get there. Okay. Well I'll start off by saying, you know, most companies when they get started, they get started with a plan or somebody's been working on an idea for a long time or, you know, and you decide, okay, now's the time, I'm just going to do this. Well waiter didn't start that way, it actually started by accident. I was going to attend a startup weekend, a building similar to this opened up in Lake Charles called the Seeds Center and I was in between things and was trying to figure out what I was going to do next. So I attended a startup weekend event in Gainesville, Florida to organize startup weekend at the Seeds Center in Lake Charles, a great way to get a startup ecosystem going and so on. And I happened to join a team that built waiter, a waiter prototype and we actually won the startup weekend competition. So on a Sunday night we were judges and winners. Now on Monday I decided, well, now what I do. I came here to learn about startup weekend, now I've got this startup, everybody thinks it's a great idea and it's a little bit of an offshoot from something I had done in the past. So do I go back to Louisiana and start this? And the first thought I had was I should stay in Florida because no one can start a successful startup in Louisiana. And that's the God's honest truth. I mean, I left Louisiana in 1991 to go work in technology. I moved to Dallas for a worth, then moved to Silicon Valley for a while and then moved to Europe for a while, all working in technology. Because in 1991 I was told if you want to work in technology you got to get out of Louisiana. So that was my first thought and then I decided, well, let me go see if I could do this in Louisiana and so I came back and started the company. So I know a little bit about the kind of the pre-weighter world. Can you tell us kind of even how the concept came to be where the idea for this delivery model even came from? Yes. So like I said, I was living in Dallas for worth in the early 2000s, 2003 to be exact. I got out of technology and got into the restaurant business because I thought, well, boiling goes are so popular in South Louisiana, maybe I could make that work up here in South Lake Texas. That's a suburb of the Dallas-Walt-Worth area. And so I opened a place with my uncle who's Acadia Crophish and Crowley called Crophish City. And for three years we sold Crophish, but what we found out real quickly is people didn't want to drive through. They wanted to come and sit down and eat, right? Correct. So that didn't really work out the way we had thought. And so I thought, well, I bet people would want food delivered to their home. And so I started a concept called Mose to Go. And it was order on the internet and we'll deliver it to your door. We'll cook it and deliver it to your door. And we did that. And I had a friend that was in the commercial kitchen business. And he had a demo kitchen with all decked out with the best equipment any restaurant tour it could hope for. So I asked him if I could lease it for three months just to test the concept. And I did and it was pretty successful. But rent was really high in that area. So I couldn't roll it out. So I put it on the back burner and then fast forward to start a weekend in 2013 and I figured all right, waiter, Mose to Go. That's really what I wanted to do except I don't have to cook the food this way. So I'll go ahead and do it that way. And it was a much better choice. That's actually why I love waiter too because I don't have to cook. I don't have to go get it. I technically don't have to clean anything. I literally just throw it all the way. I think I told Jude, where is he? I told Jude, he was wearing me out. I just want you to know that. You got a good soldier. He was wearing me out. They had been in the center for, y'all been in the center for, I don't know. What? A couple months? And he goes, man, why haven't you ordered anything? I was like, ah, you know, I don't know. I don't know. So finally, I was like, ah, I'm going to order. Kids you not. So if I ordered on Friday, I ordered again on Sunday. And Tuesday, then Wednesday at lunch, then Wednesday at night. And I came in and I went, damn it Jude. You ruined my life, man. And now my wife, the other night, she goes, hey, I'm going to be late at work. But don't worry, I just waited. I love it. It's a verb now, right? I waited. I waited dinner. And I went, ah, damn, I just did the same thing. I got one going to the hospital where she was. Got one coming to my house. I was like, you know, I would have, no, that's actually works out better. I should have done a good one. I'm glad you. That's what we should have done. Absolutely. So it was beautiful. It was beautiful. So tell me about the start-up weekend thing because I feel like there's probably a pain point in there somewhere. When you won this thing, I'm assuming you won some money that went along with some fun seed money, some kind of prize, something like that, right? Yeah, that's what you would think. Start-up weekend is actually an event that's sponsored by Google. And it's put on all over the world. But you don't win money. It's not a, it's a start-up competition for you win legal services, accounting services, time in an incubator, different kinds of things that start-ups need to get started. We won those things. However, those were all in Gainesville, Florida. Correct. So we never were able to take advantage of them because I came back to Lake Charles, Louisiana. So, but that's what you win in those events. So we didn't have seed money to start with. So we had to go figure out how we were going to get seed money. Now we had a great idea. We had people who told us, you know, through the customer development stuff we did at start-up weekend that said, yes, we would order and we would buy from you. Sure. But now we had to go figure out really how to build a company. Correct. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
